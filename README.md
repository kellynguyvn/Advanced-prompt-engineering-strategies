# Advanced prompt engineering strategies

a) Write a colab illustrating all the various prompt engineering techniques discussed in the class with gpt 4 or gpt 3.5

You should illustrate failure cases and how these are solved by various prompting techniques

b) Write 21 different prompt templates in class slides practical examples in colab (success and failur cases)   - check slide deck etc.,. https://www.promptingguide.ai/papers

and the below patterns from https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.11382.pdf

c)  Pick 10 diverse fields (like hr, teaching, finance etc..,) and write three very useful diverse prompts for each field with test cases.   

 

Follow best practices in https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-openai-api

 

d) Implement the https://platform.openai.com/examples for palm 2 api. 

 

in colab

 

e) write function calls api example colab usecase of openai

 

f) write system prompt example usecase of openai
